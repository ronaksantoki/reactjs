    <p>Lord Krishna is perhaps the most charismatic avatar of god Vishnu, and he is one of the most popular among Hindu Gods and Goddesses. Not only are his stories fascinating and inspiring, but they are also at times relevant to human lives. #1. Shri Krishna was born as the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva in Rohini Nakshatra. </p>
